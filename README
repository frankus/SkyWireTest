This is a very basic test app that opens an input and output stream to the Southern Stars SkyWire cable. 

This cable will allow you to talk to (I believe) arbitrary RS-232 devices on a non-jailbroken device. However I'm not sure how the App Store review folks will feel about apps that repurpose the cable.
